# Copilot Commit Message Instructions

When writing commit messages, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use the imperative mood**: Start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
2. **Be concise**: Keep the subject line under 50 characters.
3. **Provide context**: In the body, explain what and why, not how.
4. **Reference issues**: If applicable, mention related issue numbers.
5. **Use bullet points**: For multiple changes, list them clearly.
6. **Capitalize the subject line**: Start with a capital letter.
7. **Use the body for details**: If the commit is complex, use the body to explain further.
8. **Avoid jargon**: Use clear language that everyone can understand.
9. **Be consistent**: Follow the project's commit message style.
10. **Proofread**: Check for spelling and grammatical errors before committing.
11. **Keep it relevant**: Ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.
12. **Limit line length**: Aim for a maximum line length of 72 characters for better readability.
13. **Use the footer for breaking changes**: If the commit introduces breaking changes, mention them in the footer.
14. **Use the footer for references**: If the commit relates to external issues or pull requests, include references in the footer.
15. **Avoid using "WIP"**: Instead of marking a commit as "WIP", create a draft pull request.
16. **Use emojis sparingly**: If your project uses emojis, use them consistently and only when appropriate.
17. **Use the present tense**: Write commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
18. **Be specific**: Clearly describe what the commit does and why it is necessary.
19. **Avoid vague terms**: Avoid using terms like "stuff" or "things" in commit messages.
